# 🛡️ Criminal Justice System – Secure Role-Based Desktop App

A Windows Forms-based desktop application built in C# with a MySQL backend, designed for secure access and management of sensitive criminal justice data. The system supports multiple user roles with distinct permissions: Admin, Police Officer, Forensics, and Investigator.

## 🔐 Features

### User Authentication

### Password Reset
- Built-in password reset with:
  - Old password verification.
  - Strong password policy enforcement:
    - Uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, minimum 8 characters.
  - Secure hashing and salting for new passwords.

### Action Logging System
- All user actions are recorded in the `app_logs` table using a custom `Logger` class, tracking:
  - Username
  - Timestamp
  - Action performed

### Secure Coding Practices
- Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Error handling and logging for maintainability and traceability.
